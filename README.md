# ChallengeNetCore

This was a 24h coding challenge.
The task was to create a WPF application that scans for nearby Bluetooth LE devices and lists them. The application should show:

* The name of the Bluetooth LE device
* The services that the device offers
* The deviceâ€™s signal strength

At the beginning of this challenge, I have zero experience with WPF development so I have 24 hours to learn it and complete the challenge.
I was successfully accomplished this challenge in 2019. 
This is public version of repo, so it lack btframework lib. Without btframework  you can not build project, this repo is for demonstration purpose only.
